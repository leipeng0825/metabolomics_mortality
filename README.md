# Prediction of 10-year all-cause mortality in older adults with age and sex specific metabolite blood concentrations and traditional risk factors in two large European cohort studies
Code files in this repository covers the main analyses:

1. Data acquisition from original database;

2. Metabolome-wide associations for all-cause mortality;

3. Metabolomic modules associated with all-cause mortality and pathway analysis;

4. Selection of metabolomic biomarkers for predicting 10-year all-cause mortality and constructing the MetaboMR clocks;

5. Discrimination and reclassification analyses of all-cause mortality using metabolic biomarkers;
